# Froggy-Game
This project was developed during the MC322 undergraduate subject, which focused on Object Oriented Programming.
The aim of this project is to create a board game using OOP, where you move a frog around a board and eat snacks to increase your score. There are 3 types of frog, so you can choose which one you want to be.  Your goal is to go around the board eating snacks in order to get a higher score while avoiding predators and falling off the board. There are also stones which can block your path.
Some frogs have random elements to the way they move, so be careful.
The game runs on the terminal.
